You just need to fill these to properties the system work:

is_talking: bool
is_thinking: bool
custom_balloons: array

if is_talking is fill and the other variables are false or empty, the teen will have a random talking balloon over his head from time to time.


if is_thinking is fill and the other variables are false or empty, the teen will have a random thinking balloon over his head from time to time.

is_talking and is_thinking can't be true at the same time, or you will have problems, remember to always reset these properties when exiting states.

if custom_balloons isn't empty and is_talking or is_thinking isn't false, the teen will have custom balloons on their head from time time.

now if you only want a ballon once, then call update_talking_balloon() or update_thinking_balloon() with these parameters:

(false, [balloonName])

The balloon will apear and dissapear after 2 secs if that happen. Remember to set both is_talking and is_thinking to false when doing this.
